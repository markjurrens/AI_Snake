ChatGPT Co-Authored self playing game of snake.
This code was developed with ChatGPT, but you will need a couple items of hardware.

First, you will need an Arduino Mega 2560 board.

Second, you will need an RA6963 or T6963c compatible 240x128 Graphic LCD.

To interconnect the devices you will need the pinout specified by this website to successfully build the 20 pin interface to marry the hardware devices together (the pins are also specified in the source code): https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-With-T6963c-240x128-Graphic-LCD/

Finally you will need the 8Uglib library which can be added in the Arduino IDE using Manage Libraries, and the limits.h library which can be found at: https://github.com/codebendercc/arduino-core-files/blob/master/v104/hardware/tools/avr/lib/gcc/avr/4.3.2/include-fixed/limits.h
